**This section details how the students can clone this repository and install
the required dependencies.**

---

First, you will need to clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone ...
```

Then, you will have to install all the dependencies with npm:

```bash
$ npm install
```

You will probably have to execute the following command in the terminal line in
order to fix the dependency issues:

```bash
$ npm audit fix
```

\* Here you can add more steps if they are required \*

```bash
...
```

**This section details how the students can run the project and execute the
tests. Include all the necessary info and related commands.**

**Here are an example of how you can explain this part to the students:**

---

Once you have completed al the steps of the [Getting Started](#getting-started)
section, you will have to execute the following command that will prepare a
localhost environment.

The command will compile all the necessary assets into a new folder called
[dist](./dist) and it will open a localhost server that allows you to do the
exercises without having to reload the page:

```bash
npm run start
```

Finally you must open a new terminal (you leave the previous one open since it
has the test server running).

In this new terminal you will have to execute the following command, which will
allow you to know in real time if you have correctly implemented the exercises.

```bash
npm run test
```

_Keep in mind that the files to which you must implement your solution are those
found inside the [src](./src) folder_

In case that you want to see in the browser the result of your solutions, you
will have to call to the function of each exercise in the same JS file:

```js
// 01-exercise.js

exercise01();

function exercise01() {
  // Here is your solution
}
```

Now you will be able to see the solution in the browser.

Once you have validated that the solution is applied correctly, you will have to
remove the call that you have made manually to the function so that the test
passes successfully.

```js
// 01-exercise.js

function exercise01() {
  // Here is your solution
}
```
